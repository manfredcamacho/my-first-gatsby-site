# My First Gatsby Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7312b674-3d0a-4db9-9cf9-c6bcd74ed9ba/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/game-station-2023/deploys)

This is my first website built with Gatsby. In this repository, I migrated a [website](https://github.com/manfredcamacho/TP1-FrontEnd-CaC-2021) that was originally built with only HTML and CSS to a Gatsby site. The goal of this project was to learn and experiment with Gatsby's capabilities and benefits.

## Installation and Usage

To run this site locally, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/manfredcamacho/my-first-gatsby-site.git
cd my-first-gatsby-site
npm install
```

Then, you can start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:8000/.
