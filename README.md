# My First Gatsby Site

This is my first website built with Gatsby. In this repository, I migrated an application that was originally built with only HTML and CSS to a Gatsby site. The goal of this project was to learn and experiment with Gatsby's capabilities and benefits.

## Installation and Usage

To run this site locally, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/manfredcamacho/my-first-gatsby-site.git
cd my-first-gatsby-site
npm install
```

Then, you can start the development server:

```sh
Copy code
npm start
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:8000/.
